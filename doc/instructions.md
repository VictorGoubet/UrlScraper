# Wikipedia links scrapper

## Goal
You have to write a program that collects the most possible unique links in 20s starting from https://www.wikipedia.org/.


## Conditions
Duration: 55min

First the evaluator will do a demo sharing his screen.

Then he will be present during the first 5min to answer questions, and during the last 5min to ensure the program runs.
## Guidelines

You are allowed to use any programming language/paradigm, and any tools to write your code. You can even deploy on a custom infra if you think you have the time.

At the 20s marks, your program must output the set of unique links, it length, the time it took and exit.

Example output:
```
Unique links: [https://wikipedia.org, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not&action=edit, https://www.allmusic.com/style/speed-thrash-metal-ma0000002874]

All discovered links must be accessible by a sequence of clicks from the main page. This property must be obvious in the implementation (no generation/modification of links).


## Assessment

The only metric, if the guidelines are respected, is the number of links outputed.

Creativity will also be appreciated but only if it shows results.
